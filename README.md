# Ball Falling Simulation in Labyrinth

This project implements a simple **image processing simulation** where a ball (represented as a red dot) falls through a labyrinth based on a static input image. The ball moves at a constant speed and stops when it passes below the yellow line at the bottom of the labyrinth.

## Task Description

- Load the input image of the labyrinth.
- The red dot marks the starting position of the ball.
- Simulate the ball falling down pixel by pixel (1 pixel every 10 milliseconds).
- The ball stops when it falls below the yellow horizontal line.
- The program generates a video showing the ball moving through the labyrinth.

## Input

- Static labyrinth images: `sl1.png`, `sl2.png`, `sl3.png`, `sl4.png`

## Output

- Video files showing the ball movement for each input image.

## Technologies Used

- OpenCV (C++)
